# BMI_Calculator

- In this Python project, I created a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. The calculator takes in a person's height and weight as input, and calculates their BMI based on the formula BMI = weight / (height^2).

- To ensure the user inputs valid values, the program performs input validation by checking that the user inputs are numeric and within reasonable ranges. If the user inputs are not valid, the program returns an error message and prompts the user to input valid values.

- Once the user inputs valid values, the program calculates their BMI and returns a message indicating their BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) based on standard BMI ranges.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, input validation, and basic math calculations, and shows how these skills can be applied to create a useful tool for calculating BMI.
